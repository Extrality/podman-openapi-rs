**unpacked** | **i64** | Unpacked is the size (in bytes) of the locally unpacked (uncompressed) image content that's directly usable by the containers running this image. It's independent of the distributable content - e.g. the image might still have an unpacked data that's still used by some container even when the distributable/compressed content is already gone. |
